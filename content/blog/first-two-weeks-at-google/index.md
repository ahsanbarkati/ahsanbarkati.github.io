# My first couple of weeks at Google

I joined Google on April 4, 2022, in the Search Serving Infrastructure team. The team's responsibility is to work on the infrastructure responsible for serving the Search stack of Google. And working on low-level systems is something I love the most. I hope that this role will give me enough challenges to quench my thirst.

It was still a remote onboarding. Before the first week, I received a package containing a brand new MacBook Pro with an M1 chip. Exciting? üòÑ Not exciting for me; I am a Linux guy. Google does give you an option to choose your machine, but my manager recommended MB Pro because all team members use the same. I didn't want to waste a lot of time setting up Linux and struggle all alone with it to make it work with the ecosystem at Google. So, I decided to go for Mac (settle with a Mac üòë).

**Week one**

I got a welcome call from my manager on my phone. Yes, on my phone because my laptop was not configured yet. On the following day, I got my google credentials set up and my laptop up and running. I was given an onboarding guide, which led me to fill out many HR-related forms. Choose a bunch of benefits like health insurance, life insurance etc. They also asked me to email a scanned copy of the physically filled form. Yes! Even in 2022, we still have to fill these government forms using a pen and not a keyboard.

Finally, after completing the form‚Äôs requirements, I started with a Noogler onboarding interactive session/training. It was a great session btw, It gave an introduction to the products at Google. The motto by which Google ‚Äúwants‚Äù to live by. Some of the interesting facts related to the history of Google and much more. I also had some somewhat boring pieces of training about policies, code-of-conduct etc. Still, overall, they were really well designed (I didn‚Äôt fall asleep during any of these).

Then comes the most exciting thing, guess what? I wish this exciting thing would have been Food, but ‚Äúremote!?‚Äù. So, the interesting thing is ‚ÄúTech‚Äù. I got a lot of videos/documents about various technology related to Search. I won‚Äôt be exaggerating if I say that I spent almost whole nights just going through these for the first few days. I really enjoyed these and am still enjoying them. Nooglers also go through a well-organised training session called ‚ÄúGoogle Tech Immersion‚Äú for the Development workflow and overview of different components. But this would start only from the third week.

My manager organised an AMA session for me with the team. They asked me many questions; no more interview questions, I mean the fun questions. With my first few interactions, I can vouch that Google has successfully created a welcoming environment and an environment of inclusion.

Google has an internal website called "stuffs" where you can order stuff to make your work more productive. You can order things like a keyboard, mouse, monitors, phone, camera etc., all for FREE. I ordered a phone because I cannot log in with my google email on my one-plus üòû. I also ordered a few accessories like a face light, webcam, and headphones.

**Week two**

It was a short week of four days; Friday was a holiday. These four days went by, mostly learning more about tech. There were some tech talks related to Machine Learning and Android, which were pretty interesting. With all these good things going on, something was making me go ‚òπÔ∏è. It was that most of my teammates use GUI based IDE, and I am a VIM guy. I know that we can get Vim key-bindings in the IDEs, but it doesn‚Äôt give you the authentic flavour. Will I have to give up VIM as well?

Fortunately, I found that there are vi-user groups, and there are documents about using Vim at Google. I followed those docs along with my previous vimrc to come up with the Vim, which seems to be working well with the Google codebase. But will I be able to use it for most of the things at Google or not? I'll come to know later. I am open to exploring the google internal IDE as well. Suppose Vim becomes hard to sustain, and it starts messing up with my productivity. In that case, I'll fall back to using the IDE with the Vim key-bindings, So I also set up the google internal IDE with the vim key-bindings. Let's see how things turn up ü§ûüèª.

I am super excited about the new things that are awaiting me. The kid inside me is waiting for the Noogler hat to arrive üòÑ and the office to open. Hopefully, once the office opens, I‚Äôll write more fanboy stuff related to Google Office and FOOD; THEY KEEP ME SENDING THE PICTURES OF FOOD!
